# Star Realms: tournament results

Seeded bot-vs-bot results, one entry per milestone (see [the design](star-realms.md)). Each entry is reproducible: the same command gives the same wins, seats, turns and unfinished games; only the timings vary.

How to read them: game `i` uses seed `base_seed + i`; bot A moves first in even games and bot B in odd ones, so each bot has half the first-player games. "As 1st" and "As 2nd" are a bot's wins as first and second player. A game that passes `--max-turns` is **unfinished**: it counts in no win rate, and win rates are out of the finished games. ms/move is the mean time inside the bot's `choose`, per decision (automatic plays aren't decisions). Any single game replays with `python -m minimax_games.games.star_realms --seed <seed> --bots <first> <second> --log`.

## Milestone 1: engine core and baselines

- Date: 2026-10-18
- Commit: `561b0a3` plus the tournament command (#47); first card slice only (trade, combat, Authority, draw and ally abilities limited to those).
- Budgets: n/a (baselines, no search).
- Machine: Apple M1 MacBook, 8 GB, macOS (Darwin 25.2), CPython 3.14.0.

### greedy vs random

`python -m minimax_games.games.star_realms tournament --bots greedy random --games 500`

| Bot | Wins | Win% | As 1st | As 2nd | ms/move |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| greedy | 500/500 | 100.0% | 250/250 | 250/250 | 0.0026 |
| random | 0/500 | 0.0% | 0/250 | 0/250 | 0.0003 |

500 games, max 300 turns, 0 unfinished, mean 22.3 turns, 3.5 s wall time.

Greedy wins every game.

### greedy vs greedy

`python -m minimax_games.games.star_realms tournament --bots greedy greedy --games 500`

| Bot | Wins | Win% | As 1st | As 2nd | ms/move |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| greedy-A | 252/500 | 50.4% | 127/250 | 125/250 | 0.0026 |
| greedy-B | 248/500 | 49.6% | 125/250 | 123/250 | 0.0026 |

500 games, max 300 turns, 0 unfinished, mean 25.5 turns, 4.9 s wall time.

The first player won 252/500 (50.4%): no measurable seat advantage for greedy play.

### random vs random

`python -m minimax_games.games.star_realms tournament --bots random random --games 500 --max-turns 1000`

| Bot | Wins | Win% | As 1st | As 2nd | ms/move |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| random-A | 253/492 | 51.4% | 124/245 | 129/247 | 0.0003 |
| random-B | 239/492 | 48.6% | 118/247 | 121/245 | 0.0003 |

500 games, max 1000 turns, 8 unfinished (seeds 191, 260, 300, 314, 339, 441, 454, 476), mean 106.6 turns over the 492 finished, 14.8 s wall time.

The first player won 242/492 (49.2%). Random games are long (finished games ran to over 700 turns) and some stall: once the Trade Row is empty, the Authority automatic play gains outpaces the damage of bots that attack only at random. Hence the higher turn cap; at the default 300, 8 of the first 100 seeds are unfinished.
